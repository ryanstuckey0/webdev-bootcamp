    <p>How can we center all the elements on a page</p>
    <p>We can use property text-align, which must be sent in the parent container.</p>
    <p>This works as long as we have inline-block elements or full-width block elements.</p>
    <p>But, if we have a block that does not take the full width, then it will not be centered.</p>
    <p>We can fix this by adding a margin CSS property. "margin: 0 auto 0 auto" will center the element.</p>
    <p>Auto centers the margin in either the horizontal or vertical direction.</p>
    <h5 id="block-not-centered">This is not centered because it has a width set.</h5>
    <h5 id="block-centered">But this is centered because it has a width set and margin set.</h5>
    <br>
    <p>Margin can be set as "top right bottom left"</p>
    <p>Or "top right&left bottom</p>
    <p>Or "top&bottom right&left</p>
