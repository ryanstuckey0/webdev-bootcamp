    <h3>Rules for how HTML is displayed on webpage without CSS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Content is everything-- Inline elements only take up as much space as the content. Block element height is
            determined by content height.</li>
        <li>Order comes from the code-- Content gets rendered in the order that the code is written.</li>
        <li>Children sit on top of parents-- In 3D space, children will be "closed to the viewer" than their parents.
            This determines which elements will be displayed in front of the others.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>CSS Position Property</h3>
    <h4>Static: All HTML elements are static by default, which means go along with default HTML flow.</h4>
    <h4>Relative: Position an HTML element relative to how it would've been positioned in static.</h4>
    <p>We can use the left, right, top, and bottom properties to move the element around.</p>
    <p>Moving an element with the relative property does not affect any element on screen.</p> 
    <p>The other elements act like it is still in it's original position.</p>
    <div id="red-square"></div>
    <div id="blue-square"></div>
    <div id="yellow-square"></div>
    <p>As you can see, this paragraph is still after where the squares would be.</p>
